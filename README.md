# Insights From Data With BigQuery

## Insights from Data with BigQuery: Challenge Lab Solved

 ### Overview
* You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

* To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

* When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. To build the solution to the challenge presented, use skills learned from the labs in the quest this challenge lab is part of. You will be expected to extend your learned skills; you will be expected to change broken queries.

* This lab is only recommended for students who have completed the labs in the Insights from Data with BigQuery Quest and understand the basics of SQL and BigQuery.
